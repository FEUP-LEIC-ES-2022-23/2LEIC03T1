# The Four Questions:


### <b>What went well?</b>
- We were able to finish all the planned issues for the iteration.
- We finally managed to work with firebase authentication service without problems.
- We were able to work with all the technologies we wanted to use for this iteration.
- We got the interface closer to the mockups.
- We managed to produce organized code and made code reviews.

---
### <b>What didn't go so well?</b>
- We got some awkward commits and some problems when working with many people in the same issue.
- It was hard to start working with some flutter widgets and its specifications e.g. ListView's height and width constraints.
- The infinite scrolling on the Search Page gave us some problems.
- It was difficult to understand how to update a stateful widget within another stateful widget.
- We didn't have time to improve on the things that didn't go so well on iteration 0.

---
### <b>What have we learned?</b>
- We learned how to work with API's. 
- We learned how to work with providers in flutter.
- We learned how to use the ThemeData.
- We learned how to use the Navigator.
- We learned how to plan an iteration.
- We learned how to use the firebase authentication service.
- We learned how to protect the main branch of a repository.


---
### <b>What still puzzles us?</b>
- We still haven't figured out how to use the firebase realtime database.
- Some details in flutter are still confusing. 
- It's difficult to know how a widget updates other widgets with state.
- It's confusing to know how we should organize the code i.e. which widgets should we extract as another component.
